## About

Express Gateway is a microservices API gateway built on top of Express.js and Express middleware. It secures your microservices and serverless functions and exposes them through APIs using Node.js, Express, and Express middleware.

This fork removes unused features such as OAuth2, CLI, generators, plugin installer, and all token-based authentication and management features (including AuthToken/RefreshToken logic, token service, token admin APIs, and related tests). All configuration and management is now done via the admin API and configuration files.
