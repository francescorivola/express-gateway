# Express Gateway (Community Fork)

This project is a community-maintained fork of the original [Express Gateway](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway) project.

## About

Express Gateway is a microservices API gateway built on top of Express.js and Express middleware. It secures your microservices and serverless functions and exposes them through APIs using Node.js, Express, and Express middleware.

This fork removes no used features such as OAuth2, CLI, generators, and plugin installer, and modernizes the codebase for maintainability and simplicity. All configuration and management is now done via the admin API and configuration files.
